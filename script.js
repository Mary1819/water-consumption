$(".fifYes").click(function () {
  $(".fifPag").text("Nice, you wasted less water by running the dishwasher when it’s full than when it only has 4 dishes, which is about 7-12 gallons of water. If you scrape the solids off the dishes before putting them in the dishwasher, the pre-rinse could be skipped. Additionally, since leaks are frequent and cause more water loss than consumption, maintain and replace your dishwasher as necessary.");

$(".fifNo").click(function () {
  $(".fifPag").text("You wasted the same amount of water when a full load and 4 dishes are getting washed by a dishwasher, which is about 7-12 gallons of water.

If you scrape the solids off the dishes, the pre-rinse step could be skipped.");
